# VTK-Geopotential-data

The idea is to represent geopotential data from a concrete instant of time and draw it over the cartography to visualize the necessary property values by using OpenGL or the VTK library.

In order to perform this kind of visualizations with the provided geopotential data two techniques were proposed: transfer function , and the isocontours construction.
